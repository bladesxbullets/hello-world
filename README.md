# hello-world
Made this one following GitHub's Hello World tutorial

Hi, my name is Jacob Frye.
I'm your friendly neighbourhood wanna-be web developer.
I like coding, but not to the point of madness.
I want to use my coding skills to earn a few bucks so as to support myself soon.
Web pages are fun. Some day, I want to make a good website where all types of writers—no matter what content they right (as long as it isn't some nonsensical hate bullshit) or what language it is in, or where they are from—can find readers and readers can find writers.
Thank you for dropping by and reading my boring rant.
Have a good day ahead!
:)
